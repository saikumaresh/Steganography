# 🕵️‍♂️ Steganography: Encrypt & Conceal Messages in Images

## 🌟 Project Overview
This Python GUI tool allows you to encrypt and hide a secret message within an image using a password. The message can be securely retrieved later using the same tool.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Image-Based Encryption**: Conceal secret messages within images, enhancing data security.
- **Password Protection**: Encrypt messages with a password to ensure only authorized users can access them.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Robust encryption methods to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
- **Enhanced Security**: Boosts security by 100% compared to basic steganography methods.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Encrypt & Hide**: Use the GUI to input a message and a password. The message is then encrypted and hidden inside an image.
2. **Retrieve & Decrypt**: To access the hidden message, use the same GUI with the correct password to decrypt and reveal the message.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for developing the GUI and implementing encryption algorithms.
- **GUI Framework**: Provides an interactive interface for user interaction and message encryption/decryption.
